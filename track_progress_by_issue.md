If you're a group, each teammate should complete this assessment individually. This is here to help you set your own personal goals during the program. No need to share your results, but be ready to share your thoughts with your mentor.

- [ ] Watch ['Mozilla & Working Open'](https://youtu.be/quKdaqlR_9w).

- [ ] Use your canvas to [start writing a README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), or landing page, for your project. Link to your README in a comment on this issue.

Week 5 and more
